🚦 CivicEye – Traffic Violation Reporting System

A crowdsourced platform where citizens report traffic violations with photo/video evidence, and authorities review, validate, and reward responsible reporters.

📌 Overview

CivicEye is a full-stack web application built to empower citizens to contribute to safer roads. Users can submit real-time traffic violation reports with images/videos, while authorized officers review each report, verify violations, and award points for valid submissions.

This project was designed with a modern UI/UX, a clean architecture, and a real-time simulation of the review and rewards workflow.
